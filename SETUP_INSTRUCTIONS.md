# 🚀 The Forge - Complete Setup Instructions

## Current Status

Your platform is **built and running** on http://localhost:3004

However, you're seeing login errors because the backend services aren't configured yet.

---

## ⚠️ Why You're Seeing Errors

The error `"Login failed [object Object]"` means:
- ✅ Frontend is working perfectly
- ✅ Login page is rendering correctly
- ❌ **Supabase database is not connected**
- ❌ **Environment variables not set**

**This is expected!** You need to configure the backend services.

## 🔧 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Use Mock Data (Fastest - No Setup Required)

I can create a mock authentication system that works without any backend setup.

### Option 2: Full Setup with Supabase (Production-Ready)

Follow these steps to get full functionality:

#### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Wait for database to initialize (~2 minutes)

#### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

In your Supabase project:
1. Go to **Settings** > **API**
2. Copy these values:
   - Project URL
   - anon/public key

#### Step 3: Create `.env.local` File

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory:

```env
# Database (REQUIRED)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Auth (REQUIRED)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=any-random-32-character-string-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3004

# AI Provider (Pick at least one - Optional for now)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-if-you-have-one
```

#### Step 4: Initialize Database

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `lib/db/schema.sql`
3. Click **Run**
4. Wait for success message

#### Step 5: Restart Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
npm run dev
```

#### Step 6: Login

- Email: `admin@foundersforge.com`
- Password: `ForgeAdmin2024!`

## 🎯 Option 1: Mock Data (Recommended for Testing)

If you just want to see the platform working **right now** without any setup:

**Tell me**: "use mock data"

I'll create a mock authentication system that:
- ✅ Works instantly (no setup)
- ✅ Lets you login and explore all features
- ✅ Shows realistic demo data
- ✅ Can be replaced with real backend later

---

## 📊 What Works Right Now (Without Backend)

Even without backend setup, these features work:

✅ **Landing Page** - Fully functional and beautiful  
✅ **UI/UX** - All components render perfectly  
✅ **Navigation** - All pages accessible  
✅ **Theme Toggle** - Dark/Light mode works  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Mobile and desktop

## 🔍 Current Error Explanation

When you try to login, you see the error because:

```typescript
1. Login button clicked
   ↓
2. POST /api/auth/login
   ↓
3. Try to connect to Supabase
   ↓
4. Supabase URL = "https://placeholder.supabase.co" (not real)
   ↓
5. Connection fails
   ↓
6. Error: "Cannot connect to database"
   ↓
7. Toast shows error (now properly formatted!)
```

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Immediate Testing
**Use mock data** - I can set this up in 30 seconds

### For Production Use
**Set up Supabase** - Takes 5-10 minutes but gives you:
- Real database
- User authentication
- Data persistence
- Production-ready backend

## 🎯 What Would You Like?

**Option A**: "Use mock data" - I'll create instant mock auth (no setup)

**Option B**: "I'll set up Supabase" - I'll wait while you configure it

**Option C**: "Show me exactly what to put in .env.local" - I'll give you the exact template
